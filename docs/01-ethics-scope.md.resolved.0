# Ethics & Scope

This tool is designed for defensive security learning and posture auditing.

Allowed:
- Passive inspection of responses (headers, cookies, redirects, HTML references)
- Policy validation (required headers, minimum standards)
- Running against domains I own OR have written permission to assess

Not allowed (non-goals):
- Payload injection or exploit simulation (XSS/SQLi probes)
- Brute forcing, credential stuffing, bypass attempts
- Scanning arbitrary third-party sites without permission
- Aggressive crawling / denial-of-service behavior

Safety controls:
- Hard domain allowlist required
- Rate limiting enabled by default
- Request timeout defaults (e.g., 10s)
- Max response body bytes (truncate)
- Respect robots.txt optional (toggle), but permission still required

Disclaimer:
- This tool is informational and does not guarantee security.
